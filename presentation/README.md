# Presentation — Modular GraphSAGE Slides

How to run locally (recommended):

1. Open a terminal in the `presentation/` folder.
2. Start a simple HTTP server (so `fetch()` works reliably):

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

3. Open `https://localhost:8000/index.html` or `http://localhost:8000/index.html` in your browser.

Notes:
- The `css/styles.css` file contains the styling and utility classes.
- The `sections/01_intro.html` file contains the title slide and intro slides (fully implemented).
- Sections 02–04 are placeholders and can be filled later.
- Navigation: use ArrowLeft / ArrowRight (Home/End supported); Prev/Next buttons are available.
